# Code challenge

A default **.env** file has been included. This contains basic security credentials only to be used in a **development environment**.

#### Setup

1. Open a terminal and enter directory
2. Run command:
`docker-compose up`
3. Once all services are running you can now access the app via:
`http://localhost:3001`
4. Optionally, you can seed the db with data through the backend service by running:
`docker-compose exec backend rails db:seed`


And that's it!

Enjoy, cheers.
